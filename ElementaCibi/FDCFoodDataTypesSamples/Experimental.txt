  "abstract": "Vegetables from the Brassica family are rich in many health-beneficial components, including \r\nhigh levels of polyphenols and glucosinolates (GSLs). However, their exact metabolite \r\ncompositions are highly affected by cultivating and environmental conditions. Here, we provide \r\nthe first report of polyphenol and GSL composition of kale and broccoli microgreens grown in \r\ngrowth chamber and windowsill environments. The samples were harvested 10 days after \r\nsowing and analyzed using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry. Principal component analysis was performed to visualize group clustering, trends, \r\nand discriminative ion features. Flavonol derivatives (21 in kale and 7 in broccoli) and \r\nhydroxycinnamic acid derivatives (14 in kale and 22 in broccoli) were identified under both \r\ngrowing conditions. Additionally, GSLs, including 7 in kale and 9 in broccoli, were detected. The \r\nresults demonstrated a clear variation in secondary metabolites between the two growing \r\nconditions. The discriminative ion features were hydroxycinnamic acid esters of flavonols and \r\nindolic GSLs. Compared to chamber conditions, hydroxycinnamic acid esters of flavonols such as kaempferol-3-disinapoyl-triglucoside-7-diglucoside, kaempferol-3-disinpapoyl-triglucoside-7-\r\nglucoside, and kaempferol-3-disinpapoyl-diglucoside-7-glucoside were found to be greater in the windowsill-grown vegetables. The contents of 4-methoxyglucobrassicin and neoglucobrassicin, \r\non the other hand, were greater in the chamber-grown ones. The results suggest that kale and \r\nbroccoli microgreens grown under commercial- and in-home-grown conditions have different \r\nsecondary metabolite compositions.",

  "studyDesign": "Materials and Methods:\r\nPlant growing, harvest, and sample preparation for chemical composition analysis\r\nTwo major members of Brassica family, broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica) and kale (B. oleracea var. sabellica), were selected. Waltham 29 mountain valley broccoli seeds and Darkibor organic (F1) kale seeds were obtained for use.\r\nWindowsill growing conditions\r\nBroccoli and kale seeds (7 g each) were scattered evenly onto perforated trays containing peat moss-based potting mix. The trays were maintained in the dark (3 days for broccoli and 4 days for kale) during germination. The trays were then placed on the windowsill and exposed to natural sunlight. The plant growth was monitored daily and watered as needed to keep the potting mix moist. Microgreens were harvested on the 11th day after planting by cutting the stems right above the soil mix. Microgreens were stored at −80 °C in a freezer after harvest for follow-up chemical composition analysis.\r\nChamber growing conditions\r\nSeeds were sowed in trays containing a soil mixture. Microgreens were grown in a plant growth chamber at 25°C, a light regime of 12 h light and 12 h dark, 50% relative humidity, and a constant illumination of 100 μmol·m-2·s-1. To minimize biological variance, the sample was harvested in three independent biological replicates. Microgreen harvesting and processing for composition analysis were carried out as in the same manner as for windowsill growing conditions.\r\nChemical composition analysis\r\nFrozen microgreens were lyophilized for 48 h using a freeze dry system. After lyophilization, the microgreens were grinded into powder form and then stored at −80 °C before extraction and chemical composition analyses.\r\nPolyphenol extraction\r\nSample powder (100 mg) was added to 5 mL of methanol−water (7:3, v/v) and then sonicated for 1 h. The slurry was centrifuged at 5000g and then filtered. The samples (2 μL) were injected into a liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) system.\r\nGSL extraction\r\nExtraction was carried out following the ISO9167-1 method. The kale powder and glucotropaeolin were transferred to the tube. The samples were extracted with boiling methanol for 20 min. The slurry was centrifuged and then the supernatant was transferred to the prepared ion exchange columns. The samples were further treated and then injected into the UHPLC-HRMS system.",
